**■ Quick Preview with Syntax Highlighting**

A quick preview extension is provided for viewing source text files with syntax highlighting. This extension handles supported file formats via Uniform Type Identifiers (UTI), rather than relying solely on file extensions. The UTI definitions include a list of associated file extensions and MIME types.

Supports custom frequently used folders for quick access to directories or to open a new terminal window directly in a specific folder.

**■ Create Terminal Window Here**

Supports opening a new terminal window in the current folder using Terminal or iTerm, making it easy to access the terminal in any directory.

**■ Copy Features**

RightMenu Master offers various copy functionalities to make file operations more convenient. You can quickly copy the full file path, file name, or folder name, or even copy files/folders directly, significantly improving the flexibility and efficiency of file management.

**■ Copy File Path**

Quickly obtain the absolute path of a file for easy reference in other apps without needing to perform cumbersome manual operations.

**■ Copy Folder/File Name**

Supports copying folder names or file names to the clipboard for easy transfer and reference.

With RightMenu Master, you can delete files or folders directly, saving time by skipping multiple steps in Finder, making the delete operation more efficient and convenient.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Finder Extension Partial Menu Not Displaying Issue

When permissions are passively confirmed and then denied, reauthorizing permissions may cause the menu to not display. In this case, you need to restart the Finder extension. Restarting the computer can achieve this, but it’s cumbersome. Here are two simpler methods:

- Method 1: Execute `killall Finder` in the command line to restart Finder.  
- Method 2: Use the system’s `Force Quit Applications` feature to reload Finder. Open the `Force Quit Applications` window using the shortcut <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>⌥</kbd><kbd>esc</kbd>, find the `Finder` application, and click the `Relaunch` button below.

### Frequent Authorization Pop-Up Issues

In the application settings, go to `General` -> `Full Disk Access` -> Click to `Grant` to add the application to the `Full Disk Access` list.
